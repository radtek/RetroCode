\b 07.2001 

<B> ver 1.6.5 </B>
	
<B> Features added: </B>

	- added function CZipArchive::SetRootPath that allows more flexible path 
	manipulations when using CZipArchive::AddNewFile and CZipArchive::ExtractFile
	- ability to set the archive system compatibility to a value different
	than the current system ID with the function CZipArchive::SetSystemCompatibility()

<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>

	- bug which caused not updating the time stamp of an extracted file
	and an exception being thrown, if the file had the read-only attribute set
	(thanks to Arnon Meydav)
	- bugs in conversion of Unix attributes
	- directories inside the archive are now recognized properly by Unix archivers
	if the archive was created for Unix platform

\b 06.2001 

<B> ver 1.6.4 </B>
	
	- fixed errors that made impossible using CZipMemFile class and 
	creation of the	archives in memory


\b 05.2001 

<B> ver 1.6.3 </B>
	
	- zlib library sources incorporated into ZipArchive library projects
(eliminates most often link errors)

\b 04.2001 


<B> ver 1.6.2 </B>

	- ZipPlatform::SetVolLabel() appends now a directory separator to the drive name (lack of it caused errors sometimes)
	- added a simple protection against compiling MFC or STL version without copying the proper files first
	- added several preprocessor directives for Borland compilers

\b 03.2001 

<B> ver 1.6.1 </B>

<B> Features added: </B>

	- non MFC dependent version (STL)
	- porting to different platforms made easier
	- possibility to read zip files created on other platforms than Windows
		(correct interpretation of file/directory attributes)
	- documentation generated (using 
	\htmlonly
	<A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" target="_blank">Doxygen </A> 
	\endhtmlonly
	)

<B>  Changes: </B>

	- LICENSING CHANGED
	- overall tuning
	- sample application updated

<B> ver 1.5.1 </B>

	- when the central directory was not located, the library throws CZipException::cdirNotFound,
	which allows distinguish from other exceptions (useful when we want to keep prompting
	the user to insert the last disk in a multi-disk spanning archive).
	- the sample application updated to reflect the above feature


\b 02.2001

<B>  Features added:  </B>

	- ability to reuse the archive after an exception thrown during extraction
	- added progress control possibilities to CZipArchive::AddNewFile, CZipArchive::ExtractFile, CZipArchive::TestFile

<B>  Changes: </B>

	- CZipArchive::FindFile operation boosted ( thanks to Darin Warling)
	- library name changed to ZipArchive

<B>  Bugs fixed: </B>

	- removed bug during extracting an encrypted file with 0 size
	- fixed bug when extracting a file with an extra field in a local file header (CFileHeader::ReadLocal)

\b 01.2001
		- Disk numbering in a disk spanning archive begins now from PKBACK# 001 not PKBACK# 000
		- Adding and extracting without a full path possible in CZipArchive::AddNewFile and CZipArchive::ExtractFile.
		- Several minor changes and enhancements
		- Changed names for several classes.

\b 11.2000
 		- Added support for password encryption and decryption.
			The encryption used in PKZIP was generously supplied by Roger
			Schlafly.

		- Unicode support added

\b 08.2000
		- Bugs fixed

\b 06.2000
\par
		the code has been completely rewritten since the very beginning;
		the main improvements are:

		- creation of the disk spanning archives with the user-defined volume size
		- ability to modify existing archives (add, delete files)
		- modification self-extracting archives
		- write buffer used for faster disk write operations 
		- one class for zip and unzip functions
		- fast adding, deleting and extracting files with a single function call
 
\b 03.2000
		- international characters in filenames inside archive are now
			converted in a compatible way with other archiving programs (they are stored
		converted to OEM inside archive).

\b 01.2000

		first version; it is just modified code from zip.c and unzip.c files
			written by Gilles Vollant and distributed with zlib library; 
			the modifications are as follows:
		- added class' wrappers
		- several bugs fixed

		- MFC support added
		- memory leaks eliminated when write error occurred
		- automatically free used memory on destruction or exception
