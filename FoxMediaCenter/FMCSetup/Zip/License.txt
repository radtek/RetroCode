Distributing ZipArchive under GNU GPL implies ZipArchive can only be used 
with software that is licensed under conditions compliant with the GPL. 
Embedding in proprietary software requires an alternative license.


\subsection s1 Alternative license for use with proprietary software


If you want to distribute software in a commercial context that incorporates ZipArchive
and you do not want to meet these conditions, you need to have a commercial license. 
The commercial license provides you with the same rights as the GNU GPL, but in 
addition allows you to embed ZipArchive library in proprietary software without 
affecting the copyright of this software. The license does not allow you to transfer these rights. 
You won't need to purchase an additional license for the future versions of the library.
<BR>
The commercial license is available free of charge for freeware and shareware
programs. If your program is distributed in a similar way to the one of the 
above, the commercial license will be granted to you free of charge as well.
<BR>
There is a fee for the commercial license for using the library in the software 
not falling into the mentioned categories. Please 
\htmlonly

 or visit

<A HREF="http://software.artpol.com.pl" target="_blank">the Artpol Software web site</A>

 to find out more. 
 <BR>
 If you wish, the commercial license document can be sent to you signed by post.
