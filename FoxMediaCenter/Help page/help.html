                <li>The brains of FOX Media Center are all in the task tray icon 
                like the one on the left. Double click on the music icon to show 
                the playlist window. Or right mouse click on the icon for a 
                popup menu. If you close the playlist window the program is 
                still running in the task tray, you need to select exit from the 
                popup menu. I like to close the playlist window with the music 
                still playing and just control the program from the popup menu 
                in the task tray.</li>
                <li>To create a playlist click on the eject button on the 
                playlist window. (At least on the skins I did). Then click 'New 
                Playlist' and type in a name. Drag and drop all the songs you 
                want for that playlist onto the playlist manager window. Then 
                click 'Play Selected' or 'Save All' to save your playlist. If 
                you have heaps of songs you can try creating a random playlist. 
                Click the 'New Random' button. In the New Random Dialog you need 
                to enter a few things. Max number of files is how many files 
                will randomly be added to the playlist. Next hit the 'Browse' 
                button to select a directory that has a lot of songs in it. Then 
                once you have a directory click the 'Add Directory' button. You 
                can add as many directories as you like. Below that is file 
                type. If you want to add MP3 files, click 'Add File Type'. You 
                can add as many files types as you like. eg. *.mpg or *.wma. 
                When selecting random files it will only select files that match 
                these file types you add. If you want the list to play totally 
                random songs each time you choose the list click the check box 
                at the bottom. 'Choose random files each time ...' Then just hit 
                Create and you have a new random playlist.</li>
                <li>Check out the popup menu options. Either from the menu 
                button on the playlist or by right clicking on the task tray. 
                You can access the settings dialog from here. The settings work 
                great for me but maybe not for you. eg start when windows starts 
                and hide in task tray rather than popup the playlist. You can 
                change skins from the menus.</li>
                <li>Another cool feature is the Activate Timed Shutdown dialog. 
                You access it from the popup menu. You can choose to play music 
                for a certain time period and then have the computer turn off. I 
                like it to slowly lower the volume over time while I am going to 
                sleep. Or if you are watching a movie in bed you can have it 
                turn off the computer after the movie has finished. Just select 
                one or the other and click the 'Start Timer' button. To cancel 
                the timer just click the popup menu one more time.</li>
