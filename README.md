# RetroCode

This is some of my code from the early 2000's. Hope someone can find it useful. I get supports requests now and then for people still using ReadToMe. Perhaps someone with some free time can clean it up and release it as freeware. I am not sure if this software works on Windows 10 or with the latest versions of Internet Explorer.
